## 📦 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager-flask.git
cd task-manager-flask
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create a `.env` file

In the root directory, create a `.env` file with the following content:

```
FLASK_APP=backend/run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

> Make sure this file exists before running database migrations or starting the app.

### 5. Initialize the database

```bash
flask db init          # Only needed once
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
```

### 6. Run the app

```bash
flask run
```

### 7. Open in your browser

```
http://localhost:5000
```
